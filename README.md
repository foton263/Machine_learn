# Machine_learn
Practical Machine Learning course project

### This is the Course Project submission for John Hopkins Univ. Practical Machine Learning , Coursera course. 

####Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

### Goal 
The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. We use any of the other variables to predict with and we should create a report describing how we built our model, how we used _cross validation_, what we think _the expected out of sample error_ is, and why we made the choices we did. We will also use our prediction model to _predict_ 20 different test cases. 

1. The submission should consist of a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file describing your analysis. Please constrain the text of the _writeup to < 2000 words_ and the _number of figures to be less than 5_. It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online (and you always want to make it easy on graders :-).
2. You should also apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test data above. Please submit your predictions in appropriate format to the programming assignment for automated grading. See the programming assignment for additional details.
